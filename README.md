# Statements and expressions 
* Conditionals
if:
if expr: statement
if-else:
if expr: statement1
else: statement2
if-elseif: if expr: statement1
elif expr: statement2
else: statement3

# Loops

for: for var in range(start [,stop [,inc]]): statements
Not unsimilar to IDL and basic, except for the range statement. var can be any variable. The range statement can take start and stop values, and an increment.
while: while expr: statements
Executes statements while the expression is true.
continue: continue
Skips the rest of the body of the loop for the current iteration and continue execution at the beginning of the next iteration.
break: break
Ends the execution of the current loop.
else: else
for and while loops can both have else clauses, which are executed after the loop terminates normally by falsifying the conditional, but else clauses are not executed when a loop terminates via a break statement.
foreach: for x in array: statements 
Loops over the array given by array. On each iteration, the value of the current element is assigned to x and the internal array pointer is advanced by one.for: for var in range(start [,stop [,inc]]): statements
